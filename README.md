# 경성대학교 링크사업단 Ecole Project  3차 강의를 위한 샘플 코드
2022년 경성대학교 링크사업단 Ecole Project 3차 강의를 위한 샘플코드입니다.
1차 강의에서 다뤘던 CloudPanel과 Appwrite를 활용하여 React.js로 간단한 CRUD를 개발하는 것을 목표로 구성되었습니다.
강의 시간을 고려하여 강의 중에 다루는 내용에 대해서 먼저 공유하고, 최종 파일은 다른 Repo로 공유할 예정입니다.
강의 관련 자료는 Technote(https://technote.graysky.co.kr)을 참조해주세요.

한 학기 중 3번의 걸친 강의 중 두 번의 밤샘 강의와 마지막 종강 강의에 참여하신 학생분들께 감사드립니다.
강의에서 다뤘던 부분 중 부족한 부분이나 궁금한 사항은 technote 연락처로 메일 주시거나 Git Issues에 남겨주시면 답변드리겠습니다.

여러분의 앞으로의 시간이 더욱 더 빛날 수 있기를 기원합니다! %^^


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
